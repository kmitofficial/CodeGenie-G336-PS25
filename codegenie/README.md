# 🚀 CodeGenie - Setup & Running Guide

## 🧩 Backend Setup

Navigate to the `codegenie` directory and install the required backend dependencies using `pip`. This includes FastAPI, Uvicorn, Transformers, Torch, and other essential libraries for the AI model and API service.

```bash
cd codegenie
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🌐 Frontend Dependency Installation

Navigate back to the `codegenie` directory and install all necessary frontend dependencies using `npm`. First, use `npm install` to fetch and set up the packages listed in `package.json`, then use `npm ci` to ensure a clean and consistent install based on the lock file.

```bash
cd codegenie
npm install
npm ci
```

---

## 🧠 Model Initialization

Navigate to the backend folder and run `main.py` to download and initialize the AI model. This script sets up the backend server using FastAPI and ensures the required model files are loaded and ready for inference.

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

 This step may take a few minutes during the first run as it downloads the model from Hugging Face.

---

## 🖥 CodeGenie UI Setup

Navigate to the `src` directory, then into the `codegenie-ui` directory and install the frontend dependencies. This UI is built with React and TypeScript, and you’ll need to run the following commands to ensure everything is properly installed and locked:

```bash
cd src/codegenie-ui
npm install
npm ci
```

---

## 🔥 Launch the CodeGenie UI

To verify that the CodeGenie UI is working correctly, run the development server using:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the React app and open it in your default browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`). You should see the CodeGenie interface up and running! 🎉

 Make sure your backend (`main.py`) is also running for full functionality.
 `npm install` fetches the dependencies, and `npm ci` ensures consistency with the `package-lock.json`.

---

## 🔗 Connect the Backend

After setting up the frontend, fire up the FastAPI backend to handle prompt-to-code requests from CodeGenie:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

 The server started successfully at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, and you’ll see real-time API requests being processed — a clear sign that CodeGenie is now communicating with the backend model.

 The `/generate` endpoint is actively handling requests coming from the React UI!

## 🚀 Launching the CodeGenie Extension in VS Code

Press `F5` in VS Code to open a new **Extension Development Host** window. This is where the CodeGenie extension loads and becomes fully functional.

You can interact with CodeGenie in these two ways:

### 🎛 Command Palette

Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) to access a range of CodeGenie commands, such as:

- CodeGenie: Generate Code
- CodeGenie: Enable Autocomplete
- CodeGenie: Toggle Inline Suggestions

This gives you quick keyboard-driven access to CodeGenie’s powerful features without leaving your workflow.
